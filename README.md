### About
HmacJava is a simple library to encrypt messages using SHA1 , SHA256 , SHA385 and SHA512.

### How to
**Step 1.** Add the JitPack repository to your build file
```gradle
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
		}
	}
```

**Step 2.** Add the dependency
```gradle
dependencies {
		compile 'com.github.jgabrielfreitas:HmacJava:1.0.1'
	}
```
**That's it!**

### Usage

```java

private final String MESSAGE = "http://www.google.com";
private final String KEY     = "123456";

...

Hmac cryptography = new Hmac();
cryptography.setCryptographyMethod(HmacSHA1);
String encryptedMessage = cryptography.cryptographyMessage(KEY, MESSAGE); // 6376564BC2581CEEED13F98CE44D4C59D8CFA930

```

> Default cryptography method is SHA512
